# Changes from original repository in day 1


Modified KeyboardEvent.keyCode to just code as it has already been deprecated and no longer supported. 

Details in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode

Next, added click events on keys using event delegation so that user can also click on the screen to play sounds.
